## Major Updates
I made some changes to accomodate processing new faastq files with the addition of stored gvcf files from a previous run. Know:
1. Configs can largely stay the same as before as long as the ref genome is the same. scaff_groups, chromosomes, and scatters can remain the same. You will need to make a new units file. I suggest prepping a units file for the new fastqs and merging into a new units file.
